## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide and codebase for interfacing Raspberry Pi with different sensors and exploring a wide range of applications. I will cover topics such as sensor data acquisition, control algorithms, IoT connectivity, and artificial intelligence. Throughout the project, we will experiment with different Raspberry Pi versions to ensure compatibility and scalability. This repository can be used as a starting point to interface Raspberry Pi with matlab/simulink ,and moreover, provides accessiblity to the other project repositories working with RPI and Matlab/Simulink.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- MATLAB with Simulink ( install Raspberry support package for Matlab and simulink )
  - https://se.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/raspberrypiio
  - https://se.mathworks.com/hardware-support/raspberry-pi-simulink.html
- Raspberry Pi (Different version)
- Sensors (starting with MPU6050)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/SamsonAdem/RPI02W_Matlab.git]

## Sensor Data Acquisation
  ### Working With MPU6050   
  Connect your rpi with mpu6050 via I2C pins and open the matlab live script file in MPU_TEST folder or click the matlab online link below.
